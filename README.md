Mandelbrot set is a set of points in the complex plane.

To elude the set of all black pixels (zero values), we follow a procedure as specified below to obtain a modified Mandelbrot. Let W(i,j) corresponds to the pixel value in the location (i, j)

Functions:
                         Main function                    : main.m

                         Modified Mandelbrot set function : md.m
